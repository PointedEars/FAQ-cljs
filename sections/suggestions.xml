    <CONTENT TITLE="Why do some posts have &lt;FAQENTRY&gt; in them?" ID="FAQENTRY" NUMID="5_1">
      <P>
        If a poster feels that the question they are answering should be
        covered in the FAQ, placing &lt;FAQENTRY&gt; in the post lets the FAQ
        robot collect the messages for easy review and inclusion. A Draft Proposal
        for the FAQ is requested and appreciated.
      </P>
    <P>
The &lt;FAQENTRY&gt; should not be used in posts except in
conjunction with a suggestion/proposal for this FAQ. It should
also not be literally quoted in replies, instead it should be
partly obscured as, e.g. &lt;FAQ**TRY&gt; or similar.
