<h2><a name="DynWr" id="DynWr">The Original DynWrite function.</a></h2>

<p id="DynWr_1">
<a href="http://jibbering.com/faq/#FAQ4_15">The quick answer in section
4.15 of the FAQ</a> defines a function called <code>DynWrite</code> that will insert <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span>
content into an <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> page by writing a string of <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> to the <code>innerHTML</code>
property of an IDed element, but only on browsers that fully support
the (Microsoft IE originated) <code>innerHTML</code> extension.
</p>

<p id="DynWr_2">
On browsers that do not provide a suitable mechanism for accessing the
element, do not implement the <code>innerHTML</code> extension and browsers that
implement <code>innerHTML</code> as a read-only property (along with Javascript
incapable/disabled browsers) no content will be inserted with this
function.
</p>

<p id="DynWr_3">
On browsers that lack the element retrieval mechanism the <code>DynWrite</code>
function is created as a simple function that just returns false. That
would allow code that called <code>DynWrite</code> to check the value returned from
a call to <code>DynWrite</code> and, if it was false, know that there would be no
point in continuing to use the function as content will never be
inserted into the document.
</p>

<p id="DynWr_4">
Unfortunately the other branch, when an element retrieval mechanism is
available, produces a function that will retrieve the element and write
to its <code>innerHTML</code> property, returning true. On the browsers that do not
implement, or fully implement, <code>innerHTML</code> this action should have no
harmful side effects, merely creating a new <code>innerHTML</code> property on the
element in browsers that do not implement the extension at all and
leaving read-only <code>innerHTML</code> properties unchanged. But the true return
value cannot be taken as an indicator of the success of the action.
</p>

<p id="DynWr_5">
Ideally the return value from <code>DynWrite</code> should be a reasonable
indicator of the success of the attempt to insert contents into the
<span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> as that would facilitate controlled degradation on un-supporting
browsers.
</p>

<p id="DynWr_6">
However, it is necessary to have a reference to an element in order
to examine it to see if it does support <code>innerHTML</code> and the testing
would alter the contents of that element (though possibly only
temporarily). As a page loads elements usually become available
(or, at least, referencable) after their opening <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> tag has been
parsed, so code defined (or imported) in the HEAD section of a page
could access the <code><span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span></code> element and the <code>HEAD</code> element along with,
possibly, the <code>TITLE</code> and any other preceding elements.
</p>

<p id="DynWr_7">
It would be theoretically possible acquire a reference to one of
these elements and determine whether it has an <code>innerHTML</code> property
and maybe then attempt to write to it to see if that had the desired
effect. In reality there is at least one <code>innerHTML</code> supporting
browser that will allow the dynamic modification of the content of
any element within the BODY but generates run-time errors if an
attempt is made to test, read or modify the <code>innerHTML</code> property of
elements within the HEAD. That rules out examining the elements
within the HEAD for <code>innerHTML</code> support and means that when <code>DynWrite</code>
is initially configured it cannot know whether it is going to be
effective or not.
</p>

<p id="DynWr_8">
It would, in principle, be possible to write the <code>DynWrite</code> functions
so that it tests the element that it is asked to insert <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> into
prior to making the attempt so that it could act (or not) and then
return true/false based on the result of those tests. But that would
be inefficient as it would require that the test be carried out on
every invocation of <code>DynWrite</code>. Iit may also be visually undesirable as
the testing strategy (described below) involves setting the <code>innerHTML</code>
to a test value resulting in two <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> modification per write operation
(which may become visually apparent).
</p>

<p id="DynWr_9">
An alternative is to exploit the flexibility of Javascript by
initially assigning a function to <code>DynWrite</code> that could carry out
the required tests and then re-assign <code>DynWrite</code> to a function that
returned a true/false value that more accurately reflected the
browser's support for the <code>innerHTML</code> extension. Allowing the tests
to be performed on an element that should be available at the time
of the test and the content of which is intended that it be replaced
so it will not matter if it is replaced with the test value because
if it was successfully replaced for the test it would then be
re-replaced with the <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> that was intended to be inserted. It also
allows the test to only be performed once as success or failure on
the first attempt should indicate the same outcome on subsequent
attempts.
</p>

<p id="DynWr_10">
<code>DynWrite</code> is initially configured based on the browser's apparent
ability to retrieve a reference to a DOM element given its ID in
the form of a string. On modern browsers the document.getElementById
function can be used to return a reference to an element given the
ID as a string. Older browsers may not implement the getElementById
function, but some may provide an alternative mechanism such as
document.all.
</p>

<h2><a name="getEl" id="getEl">Element retrieval given the element ID as a string.</a></h2>

<p id="getEl_1">
Several approaches can be taken towards maximising the ability
to retrieve references to DOM elements.
</p>

<p id="getEl_2">
1. Writing a general element retrieval function such as:-
</p>

<pre id="getEl_ex1">
function getElementWithId(id){
    var obj = null;
    if(document.getElementById){
        <span class="commentJS">/* Prefer the widely supported W3C DOM method, if
           available:-
        */</span>
        obj = document.getElementById(id);
    }else if(document.all){
        <span class="commentJS">/* Branch to use document.all on document.all only
           browsers. Requires that IDs are unique to the page
           and do not coincide with NAME attributes on other
           elements:-
        */</span>
        obj = document.all[id];
    }
    <span class="commentJS">/* If no appropriate element retrieval mechanism exists on
       this browser this function always returns null:-
    */</span>
    return obj;
}
</pre>

<p id="getEl_3">
2. Assigning one of many functions tailored to element retrieval on
the current browser to a global variable that can then be used to
call the element retrieval function.
</p>

<pre id="getEl_ex2">
var getElementWithId;
if(document.getElementById){
    <span class="commentJS">/* Prefer the widely supported W3C DOM method, if 
       available:-
    */</span>
    getElementWithId = function(id){
        return document.getElementById(id);
    }
}else if(document.all){
    <span class="commentJS">/* Branch to use document.all on document.all only
       browsers. Requires that IDs are unique to the page
       and do not coincide with NAME attributes on other
       elements:-
    */</span>
    getElementWithId = function(id){
        return document.all[id];
    }
}else{
    <span class="commentJS">/* No appropriate element retrieval mechanism exists on
       this browser. So assign this function as a safe dummy.
       Values returned form calls to getElementWithId probably
       should be tested to ensure that they are non-null prior
       to use anyway so this branch always returns null:-
    */</span>
    getElementWithId = function(id){
        return null;
    }
}
</pre>

<p id="getEl_4">
3. Using a feature of a browser to emulate getElementById on a browser
that does not implement it. So that getElementById can be used as a
general element reference retrieval method.
</p>

<pre id="getEl_ex3">
<span class="commentJS">/* Emulate getElementById on document.all only browsers. Requires
   that IDs are unique to the page and do not coincide with NAME
   attributes on other elements:-
*/</span>
if((!document.getElementById) &amp;&amp; document.all){
    document.getElementById = function(id){return document.all[id];};
}
</pre>

<p id="getEl_5">
The reason for the comment about the use of ID and NAME attributes is
that the <code>document.all</code> collection does not have exactly
analogous behaviour with the <code>document.getElementById</code> method.
If multiple elements have the same ID (or share an ID with the NAME of
other elements) then <code>document.all</code> returns a collection
instead of an individual element, while <code>document.getElementById</code>
only ever returns an individual element or <code>null</code>. However,
ID attributes are supposed to be unique to an <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> page if that page
is valid <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> 4 so multiple identical IDs should not be a problem.
The issue with IDs coinciding with NAMEs remains, though it would not
be good <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> design to provoke that problem.
</p>

<p id="getEl_6">
Also, when a string used to refer to a property of the <code>document.all</code>
collection does not refer to an element or a collection of elements
<code>undefined</code> is returned by the above function. In most
type-converting tests <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code>
behave the same (they both convert to boolean <code>false</code>)
so the distinction is not necessarily important.
</p>

<p id="getEl_7">
However, a more cautious but slower getElementById emulation could be
used. Including tests that ensure that its behaviour exactly matched
the W3C getElementById method.
</p>

<pre id="getEl_ex4">
<span class="commentJS">/* Emulate getElementById on document.all only browsers. */</span>
if((!document.getElementById) &amp;&amp; document.all){
    document.getElementById = function(id){
        var tempEl = null, el = document.all[id];
        if(el){ <span class="commentJS">//document.all returned something.</span>
            if((!el.id)||(el.id != id)){
                <span class="commentJS">/* Either this is a collection or the only element
                   available under the property name provided as the
                   - id - parameter is a named element:
                */</span>
                if(el.length){ <span class="commentJS">//assume it is a collection.</span>
                    <span class="commentJS">/* But it might be an element with a NAME
                       corresponding with the id parameter that has
                       collection-like behaviour such as a form or a
                       select element so proceed with caution:
                    */</span>
                    for(var c = 0;c &lt; el.length;c++){
                        if((el[c].id)&amp;&amp;(el[c].id == id)){
                            <span class="commentJS">/* Set tempEl to the first match and
                               break out of the - for - loop:

                            tempEl = el[c];

                       will not have changed:

                    el = tempEl;
                }else{ <span class="commentJS">//only a named element is available for id.</span>
                    <span class="commentJS">/* getElementById should not return named elements

        }else{ <span class="commentJS">//el is undefined so make it null;</span>
            el = null;
        }
        <span class="commentJS">/* The returned value will be the first element confirmed as
           having the corresponding ID or it will be null:
        */</span>
        return el;
    };
}
</pre>

<p id="getEl_8">
One of the consequences of creating a function to emulate
<code>getElementById</code> is that other scripts that use the
existence of <code>document.getElementById</code> to infer the
existence of features of the browser beyond the getElementById method
may wrongly infer that a browser that is provided with the emulation
may have features that it does not have (unless they have also been
emulated). This should not be a problem as using a test on one feature
to infer the existence of other features is a <strong>fatally flawed
technique</strong>, the use of which <strong>is discouraged</strong>.
</p>

<p id="getEl_9">
I will be using the third approach, emulating the
<code>document.getElementById</code> method, in the modified
<code>DynWrite</code> function (with notes on what would differ
with either of the first two).
</p>

<h2><a name="innHTest" id="innHTest">innerHTML Testing Strategy.</a></h2>

<p id="innHTest_1">
Initially testing an element to see if <code>innerHTML</code> is supported simply
involves using the <code>typeof</code> operator to see if it returns
<code>&quot;string&quot;</code>. That test will identify browsers such as Opera 6,
where the <code>innerHTML</code> property is undefined.
</p> 

<p id="innHTest_2">
The second test is based on the fact that when the <code>innerHTML</code> property
of an element is read on a supporting browser the value returned is
normalised <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> and not the literal <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> source code. However, all
browsers seem to take a different attitude when generating that
normalised source. So given the original <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> source:-<br><code>&lt;td
CLASS=&quot;obj&quot;&gt;&lt;U&gt;firstChild&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/td&gt;</code><br>
the corresponding <code>innerHTML</code> of the parent element reads <br><code>&lt;TD
CLASS='obj'&gt;&lt;U&gt;firstChild&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;</code><br> on
Opera 7.11, <br><code>&lt;TD class=obj&gt;&lt;U&gt;firstChild&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;
</code><br> on IE 5.0 and <br><code>&lt;td 
class=&quot;obj&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;firstChild&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
</code><br> on Mozilla 1.2.
</p>

<p id="innHTest_3">
None of these correspond with the original <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> but they are also
different from each other. What is needed for the test is <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span>
source that all supporting browsers will return as different text
from the source assigned. For that task a mixed case <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> string with additional
unnecessary whitespace characters is used. That test <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> is appended
to the original <code>innerHTML</code> value to ensure that the test string will
never be equivalent to either the original <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> or the normalised
result of reading the innnerHTML property after the assignment, even
by accident. The fact that the browser has normalised the source is
taken as indicating that the browser supports the <code>innerHTML</code> extension.
</p>

<p id="innHTest_4">
After writing the test <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> to the <code>innerHTML</code> property it is possible
to determine whether the property is read only by comparing a stored
copy of the original value against the retrieved value. This is also
necessary because otherwise the fact that the returned <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> does not
correspond with the testHTML would be taken as indicating that
it had been normalised.
</p>

<p id="innHTest_5">
Finally, it is necessary to determine whether inserting the test
<span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> has added the element that it defines to the DOM for the page.
</p>

<p id="innHTest_6">
When those tests are passed correctly the <code>DynWrite</code> function can be
replaced with a new function that does not bother repeating the tests
for subsequent assignments to <code>innerHTML</code>. If the tests are failed
then the <code>DynWrite</code> function replaces itself with one that does no
more than return false to indicate its failure.

<span class="commentJS">/* [1] Notes on the body string to use if the tests are passed:-
   The existing function body string relies on the use of
   the getElementById emulation approach to retrieving DOM element
   with an ID. If the getElementWithId function was used the
   appropriate equivalent body string would be:-

&quot;getElementWithId(id).innerHTML = S;return true;&quot;

   However, if the ID passed as a parameter to DynWrite does not
   correspond with an existing IDed element then either of these two
   options would result in a function that would generate run-time
   errors. For development that is probably a good thing as the
   resulting error should be corrected in either the <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span> or the
   script code by ensuring that the ID string provided does refer to a
   uniquely identified DOM element.  On the other hand, having fully
   tested the code, the body string might be best swapped in deployed
   code to a more cautious version that checked the result of the
   element retrieval call to ensure that it is a non-null object:-

&quot;var el=document.getElementById(id);if(el){el.innerHTML=S;}return true;&quot;

   - with the getElementById emulation or:-

&quot;var el=getElementWithId(id);if(el){el.innerHTML=S;}return true;&quot;

   - with the getElementWithId function.
   
   These function body strings are still returning true. How
   suited that is to the situation would depend on how the code
   intended to respond to the return value. The inability to resolve
   one ID does not indicate that innerHTML would not available on
   others if they could be resolved so code that decides to stop
   attempting to write to innerHTML upon the first false return
   value might be better off using the previous strings. Code that
   wanted to fall-back based on each attempt to write to innerHTML
   would be better using a function body string that returned
   true/false based on the success of each individual attempt. For
   the body string that tests to ensure that the element reference
   is recovered a boolean return value based on the success of the
   element retrieval would be best suited. That is simplest achieved
   with a double NOT operator - return !!el; - . A null value of
   - el - would return boolean false and an element reference would
   return true due to type-converting forced by the NOT operator:-

&quot;var el=document.getElementById(id);if(el){el.innerHTML=S;}return !!el;&quot;

   - with the getElementById emulation or:-

&quot;var el=getElementWithId(id);if(el){el.innerHTML=S;}return !!el;&quot;

   - with the getElementWithId function.

This design of the function does not involve any configuration tests
as the page loads. It is one simple function definition. In principle
calling the function with appropriate parameters will always return
false if the content inserting is not possible and true otherwise.
With the tests being performed only on the first invocation of the
function.

Given the <span class="initialism" title="HyperText Mark-up Language"><abbr title="HyperText Mark-up Language">HTML</abbr></span>: <code>&lt;div ID=&quot;anID&quot;&gt;old
&lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code> examples of usage might be:-

<pre id="AltDynWr_ex2">
if(!DynWrite(&quot;anID&quot;, &quot;new &lt;code&gt;HTML&lt;\/code&gt;&quot;)){

It has been observed that IE 4 errors if DynWrite is called before the
onload event is triggered by the browser. So to maximise cross-browser
support for this function it would be better not to use it prior to that
point.
